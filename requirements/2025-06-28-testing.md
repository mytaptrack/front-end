# Automated UI testing
Automated user interface testing will leverage selenium in order to test the user interface and capabilities.

# Systems being tested
There are two websites which need to be tested and maintained: behavior and management. These websites are built separately but are both single page applications.

# Validation of saved data
Data should be validated by refreshing the web browser and navigating to the data. After making a modification it can take up to 2 seconds for that modification to display in refreshed data.

- Behavior
    - User login
    - Enrollment of a student
