# Roles
There are two types of roles in mytaptrack behavior tracking: Admin and Nonadmin

# Admin user
The admin user has the ability to enroll new students, then invite non-admins to that student. The non-admins can be given full administrative privileges over that student, but cannot create new students.

## Management site
In the management site only administrators can log into the site.

# Non-admin user
Non-admin users can create their own account, and can be invited to a student's team. These users can be given either limited access or full access to the student.

## Management site
In the management site, if non-admins try to log in, the user will be redirected to the behavior site.
