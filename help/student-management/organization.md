# Student Organization

This guide covers best practices for organizing students in mytaptrackÂ®.

## Using Tags

Tags are a powerful way to organize and group students:

### Creating Tags
1. Add tags when creating a new student
2. Edit existing student profiles to add/modify tags
3. Use consistent tag naming conventions

### Tag Best Practices
- Use grade levels (e.g., "Grade-3")
- Include program identifiers (e.g., "IEP", "504")
- Add location information (e.g., "Room-123")
- Use case-specific tags (e.g., "Math-Support")

## Managing Multiple Students

- Sort by various criteria (name, grade, etc.)
- Use search functionality for quick access
