# Duration Tracking

This guide explains how to use duration tracking for behaviors in mytaptrackÂ®.

## Setting Up Duration Tracking

1. When creating or editing a behavior:
   - Check the "Duration" checkbox
   - Save the behavior settings

2. The behavior will now track both:
   - Frequency (number of occurrences)
   - Duration (length of time)

## Using Duration Tracking

### Mobile App
1. First tap: Starts the duration timer
2. Second tap: Stops the timer and records the duration
- Look for the "play" symbol indicating duration tracking

### Browser Interface
1. Click "Start" to begin timing
2. Click "Stop" to end timing
3. Duration is automatically calculated and recorded

## Viewing Duration Data

### Dashboard View
- See average durations
- View duration trends
- Compare durations across time periods

### Reports
- Access detailed duration statistics
- Export duration data
- Generate duration-specific reports

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Timing**
   - Start timing at the same point in the behavior
   - End timing using the same criteria
   - Document timing criteria in behavior description

2. **Data Quality**
   - Avoid extremely short durations
   - Check for incomplete timing sessions
   - Review unusual duration patterns

3. **Team Communication**
   - Ensure all team members understand timing criteria
   - Use consistent start/stop points
   - Document any timing methodology changes
