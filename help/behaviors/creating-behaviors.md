# Creating Behaviors

This guide explains how to create and manage behaviors for tracking in mytaptrackÂ®.

## Creating a New Behavior

1. Select the student from the list
2. Navigate to the Behaviors tab
3. Click "Create Behavior"
4. Fill in the behavior details:
   - Name: Use clear, specific language
   - Description: Provide an operational definition
   - Duration tracking (optional)

### Behavior Naming Best Practices
- Use specific, observable terms
- Align with IEP or intervention plan language
- Keep names concise but descriptive

### Behavior Descriptions
- Define the behavior operationally
- Include examples and non-examples
- Specify any relevant contexts or conditions

## Copying Behaviors

To copy behaviors from another student:
1. Select "Copy behaviors from another student"
2. Choose the source student
3. Select behaviors to copy
4. Modify as needed for the current student

## Setting Tracking Options

### Duration Tracking
- Check the "Duration" box for behaviors that need time measurement
- Leave unchecked for frequency-only tracking

### Frequency Tracking
- Automatically enabled for all behaviors
- Counts occurrences without timing

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Language**
   - Use the same terms across similar behaviors
   - Match terminology with educational plans

2. **Clear Definitions**
   - Make descriptions specific and measurable
   - Include all necessary context

3. **Regular Review**
   - Update behaviors as needed
   - Archive obsolete behaviors
